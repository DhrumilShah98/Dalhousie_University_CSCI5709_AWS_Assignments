## Feature Developed: Social Clean Reporter Management - EnviClean Patron
I have implemented the Social Clean Reporter Management â€“ EnviClean Patron feature for the EnviClean web application. This feature provides an interface for the EnviClean patron members to seamlessly identify all the trash they find when they are outside and upload it on the EnviClean website. Garbage collectors are intimated to make sure that the reported garbage is taken care of properly. This feature covers the following tasks:

* Enroll as a social clean reporter and become an EnviClean Patron.
* Create a post regarding the garbage found.
* View posts created by other users.
* View posts created by users themselves.
* Search posts (By address - street address, city, province, zip code)
* Delete posts created by users themselves which are not fulfilled by garbage collectors.

All the necessary details regarding the feature Social Clean Reporter Management - EnviClean Patron (i.e., sitemap, wireframes, task flow diagrams, process workflows, use cases and, click streams) is covered in Assignment 1, Project Proposal and Assignment 2.

Note - Fulfil patron post is part of the collectors' job. Collectors will fulfil patron posts (i.e., Collect garbage and mark it as status - FULFILLED). It is one of the tasks of another feature and will be implemented later by another team member under the Collector navigation menu(i.e., For user type - Collector).
